                            <p>Hello everyone, I am extremely new to arduino, and I have joined a small group that wants to create a small first time app. The thing what i would like to do is just get pulse readings and if its above certain level a red light would turn on otherwise a green light. Unfortunately the group is no experienced either with electronics. What i would need help with is finding the pulse sensor for a online simulator. I used id.arduino.cc and thinkercad but could not find the components.  Had this saved in a table.

Hello i am trying to get involved with arduino, i have used one before and made a couple of (very) simple projects but all of them were made by following step-by-step instructions from a video or messing around with code on a simulator untill i get the desired result. Now in trying to obtain more general knowledge so that i can feel more independent in creating projects, but all the online resources that i find are just guides on how to make a specific project. I don’t find myself terribly exciting, but maybe you will, lol. I’m a visual artist who instead of working on my MFA application, website design, or exit loan counseling is writing this. Not the best use of my time but since finishing up my BFA I’ve been feeling kinda lonely. And I have large pack of envelopes and stamps left over from a project that ended up going in a different direction. amp#x200B; I’ve had a handful of penpals over the years, none recently though. I had one that lasted. I am a recent EET graduate and as a student I learned C, took a Micro class in which we only used a micro simulator (Proteus), and did a bunch of Arduino stuff. I want to practice embedded programming with a real micro and brush up on C (I'm a bit rusty despite killing it in both my C and Micro classes). The only microcontroller I own at the moment (aside from, ya know, Arduinos) is an ATtiny817 Xplained Mini board. I also have Atmel Studio installed on my computer and I've been told by a frien. I compiled a list of all the software in this thread that got a 1000+ score (in order from top to bottom), along with a short description of each. ampnbsp; Over 1000 upvotes: 1.

I've been flying my Dromida Vista for about 2 years and it's fun, but watching the videos online makes me want to upgrade to something more powerful. I tried flying the vista in its acro/no stabilisation mode but it didnt work as it would just start wobbling when I let go of the sticks. I wanted to buy the parts but couldn't bring myself to doing it so I wanted to try a simulator first. To fly I would need a transmitter which I would connect to the PC but I went the cheapest route This is my FYP project the problem is that I have very limited experience in this require guiadance if anyone is willing to give. My professor told me to collect data for the states we want to to use to control the movement of our robot i.e thinking,meditation, and other emotional or physical states using Emotive handset which I don't have at the moment. my question is how is there any alternative software that would allow me to acquire and visualize the data of these signals without I've picked out some resistors for a max +-2.5V signal output to max +-2.048V for an ADC. I'm particularly worried about accuracy and precision, not battery drain. According to my calculations/online calculator/ circuit simulator, (http://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html?cct=$+1+0.000005+1.3241202019156522+59+5+69%0Ag+368+96+368+32+0%0Ar+368+96+272+96+0+3900%0Ar+80+96+192+96+0+910%0AR+16+96+16+32+0+0+40+2.5+0+0+0.5%0Aw+80+96+16+96+0%0Ap+192+176+192+240+1+0%0A370+192+96+272+96+1+0%0A370+1.

So, as I've posted in some of the replies, I had been thinking of working on an RPO fan fic, to which I have written some on. But, I realize that the story is getting way too close to coming off as a rip-off to RPO than it is as a tie-in story. So, I've decided to stop because of the strikingly similarities to the concept of the character I had come up with seeming too similar to Wade's story. This includes having geeky parents, having issues with love via OASIS and whatnot. But the basic. 
I know nothing about this field, but am willing to learn, IF I can figure out where to get started! I've been in communication with the inventor and an assistant who built the control boards and helped with the original software, but communication is slow and inconsistent. Either I can't seem to find the right words to ask them specifically what I need to know in order understand how these work, or they're just so far beyond my level of knowledge that we cannot communicate properly. Here's. TL;DR: Any cool Ardunio/RaspPi/Custom projects for flying? Especially with print outs to go with them for mounting! Hello all, Total beginner here, I just did my first solder job in years (mSata power and data connector pins) an hour ago but the wife promise me to have a me day tomorrow and we are going to the two shops in my city that sell electronic supplies :) I recently started to get into the mid-high-but-not-full-cockpit-crazy flight sim rage again despite my wife's disdain. I'm x-posting this from /r/flying, arduino and so a few things should say KSP instead of "game X" but everything else applies TL;DR: Any cool Ardunio/RaspPi/Custom projects for flying? Especially with print outs to go with them for mounting! Hello all, Total beginner here, I just did my first solder job in years (mSata power and data connector pins) an hour ago but the wife promise me to have a me day tomorrow and we are going to the two shops in my city that sell electronic supplies. I'm not completely ignorant of electronics, but I am new to Arduino building I can't find a similar example online to answer my question. I just want to make a simple control panel that hooks to a PC. Buttons, rocker switches, etc. Similar to what people make for flight simulators. The only problem is, everyone likes to show off their panels but no one will show the guts. They just swing their cellphone around a table that's lit by candle light. Alright, the simple question: Arduino Leonardo. Hello all, I'm completely new to SDR and RF anything, so please pardon my profound ignorance, but I want to learn and got interested in rf wave harmonics from watching a few youtube videos. I've played with online simulators but I'm more a hands on learner. Specifically, I'd like to play around with a signal generator and oscilloscope to measure phase shifted harmonics in antennas; ~~vhf~~ UHF! range, simple sine waves. Would like to output a sine wave at a single frequency, split it, phase. Hey guys! I'm having some trouble figuring out the best path from here to having a complete, permanent device. I'm new to Arduino, but I've done a lot of research and have a specific project I'm working on that's very similar to what this guy did ( I want this to be a permanent device that looks nice (I might even do a 3D printed case for it), so it won't be sitting on the breadboard. I'm anxiously waiting for my first Arduino kit to arrive and I was wondering if anyone knew if there was an Arduino online emulator (or rather simulator) Hi I'm using a throwaway because I don't like people knowing about my aspergers. I have a strong desire to better myself and I occasionally find something I am interested in learning or doing and currently I want to learn to make games using unity. The problem I always have however is that after the initial excitement has died down I have an awful lot of trouble continuing with whatever it is I'm doing. For instance I bought an arduino kit and learning book so that I could build cool projects. Hi! I want to create an app that fetches and displays values from sensors hooked up to an arduino. I want to do that with xamarin / android for my first try. Now, since I don't have the arduino with sensors set up yet, I want to make a simulator that sends out "fake" measurements over the internet, that I can try and connect to with my planned android app. My Question now is: How should I do this? I think the answer is "set up the nubmer generator as a service from a web server"
